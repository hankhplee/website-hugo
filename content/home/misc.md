Besides an HCI researcher, I'm also a passionate event planner, of which I believe activities and events are the best modality to motivate people to act and provide inspiration to lives. Events that I've organized include <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/19444">TEDx annual conferences</a>, <a href="https://hackathon.nctu.me">Hackathon</a>, and innovative entrepreneurs' competition.
