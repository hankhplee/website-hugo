My name is Hank, and my Chinese name is Hao-Ping Lee (李浩平). I'm a Research Assistant supervised by [Prof. Yung-Ju (Stanley) Chang](https://www.armuro.info/) at National Chiao Tung University, where I also earned my bachelor degree in computer science in 2018. I was a Visiting Researcher at the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of [Dr. Tilman Dingler](http://tilmanification.com/). My research experiences lie at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), while specifically in investigating on:
<ol>
  <li> social and contextual factors that affect instant messaging (IM) on mobile.</li>
  <li> using prior IM communication pattern to model users’ IM behaviors.</li>
  <li> novel interactions for ubiquitous technologies.</li>
</ol>
